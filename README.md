# BCH error-correcting code implementation in Matlab

This project was part of a directed study in the EECS department of the University of Michigan in the Winter, 2011 semester. The group I worked with conducted research on memristor memory technologies. I apologize for the lack of documentation; I wrote this code as a junior in undergrad prior to appreciating the importance of proper documentation.
